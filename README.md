# Password Generator Project

## Description

This project we used JavaScript to generate a random password from the criteria that the user inputs.
How it works is prompts will appear on the screen for users to answer and then after all of the prompts are answered a randomized password will be created for the user to copy and paste.

What I did first was created all the prompts for the user to answer.
I then created "if" statements. 

finally all the heavy lifting is being done with the for loop at the botton.

This was especially challenging to complete and have it generate a random password. I learned a lot about how 
we need to provide logic to the code to make it function properly. I will go back and tweak it more to get the results that I want it to have.
